"12111",804320,"3/5/2019","",2,NA,NA,"M","","This is a literature case, initially received on 19-Feb-2019, concerning a 2-year-old, male child. The study describes the reports of anaphylaxis after vaccination reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1990-2016. A descriptive analysis, including history of hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis, respiratory allergies, and drug allergies) and vaccines given were performed. The patient's medical history included premature birth at 33 weeks of gestation, hypoplastic left heart syndrome with subsequent cavopulmonary shunt procedure. The current conditions of the patient included periodic cyanosis. On an unspecified date, the patient was administered INN Flu Vaccine Seasonal (anatomical location, dose, route of administration, batch number, manufacturer, trade name and expiry date: not reported) for an unknown indication. On the same day, the patient was also administered a combined non-company suspect vaccine, Measles vaccine;Mumps vaccine;Rubella vaccine;Varicella zoster vaccine (anatomical location, dose, route of administration, batch number, manufacturer, trade name and expiry date: not reported) for an unknown indication. On the same day, 20 minutes after the vaccination, the patient experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest and the patient died. Autopsy was performed, and the cause of death was reported as anaphylactic reaction (related). On post-mortem laboratory tests revealed an increased serum tryptase level. The outcome of the event cardiopulmonary arrest was not reported. The reporter assessed this case as serious (death).; Reporter's Comments: A 2-year-old, male patient with medical history/concurrent condition (premature birth at 33 weeks of gestation, hypoplastic left heart syndrome with subsequent cavopulmonary shunt procedure and periodic cyanosis) experienced fatal cardiopulmonary arrest, 20 minutes after administration of INN Flu Vaccine. The autopsy reported the cause of death as anaphylactic reaction. The case meets level 2 of Brighton Collaboration criteria of diagnostic certainty for anaphylactic reaction. Considering the plausible temporal relationship between vaccination and reported fatal events (anaphylactic reaction and cardiopulmonary arrest) and lack of alternative more plausible causes, the company conservatively assessed the events as possibly related to suspect vaccine. However, co-administered combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine was considered as non company suspect in this case. The company assessed the event 'anaphylactic reaction' as serious (medically significant).; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Anaphylactic reaction.","Y","","","","",NA,"","","N","","",NA,"Test Name: Serum tryptase level; Result Unstructured Data: Increased.","UNK","","","Cyanosis (The patient had periodic cyanosis.)","Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Cavopulmonary anastomosis (The patient had hypoplastic left heart syndrome with subsequent cavopulmonary shunt procedure.); Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (The patient had hypoplastic left heart syndrome with subsequent cavopulmonary shunt procedure.); Premature birth (The patient was born premature at 33 weeks gestation.)","","USSEQIRUS201902085",2,"3/4/2019","","","","","MMRV","UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER","","UNK","UN","UN","MEASLES + MUMPS + RUBELLA + VARICELLA (NO BRAND NAME)","Anaphylactic reaction",22,"Autopsy",22,"Cardio-respiratory arrest",22,"Death",22,"Tryptase increased",22

Yesterday he got a swollen right thigh at vaccine site and developed fever to 102.8. He was shaking at the time of fever and--with his seizure history-- parents wondered if could have been seizure (vs shaking with fever). Parents gave him Benadryl and took him to Urgent Care, where he was deemed to be having a vaccine reaction. He has not been walking well, and parents noted some puffiness around his eyes, so they brought him into the office today. He was febrile in the office and was walking holding onto dad's hand, gingerly, not wanting to bear weight on sore leg. There is tenderness, calor and splotchy erythema at his leg, but parents reports I am seeing it the way it looks improved after Benadryl.  No breathing problems/clear chest on exam. Mild periorbital edema bilaterally. No hip, knee or ankle pain. The area does not look like infection/cellulitis at this point, and--especially with the way it responds to Benadryl-- I feel his is a vaccine reaction. I have advised continuing Motrin q 6 hrs and Benadryl q 6 hrs and returning should fever persist in the next one to two days or should pain or symptoms worsen or continue.","","","","","",NA,"","","N","4/29/2019","5/30/2019",31,"CBC done in office, largerly unremarkable with WBC 11, 400 (84n)","PVT","","None until his leg started hurting and swelling-- now family is managing with Benadryl and Motrin","no recent illness","4 yr M with hx benign neonatal familial convulsions, weaned off phenobarbital after 12 months.

Again the doctor said it was possible but unlikely and that perhaps she had contracted rosacea (??!) At this time she has been fever free for about 36 hours and has had a rash for 48 hours. The rash now covers her entire body from head to toe and is itchy to the point that she is uncomfortable in clothes or a diaper and has difficulty sleeping.","","","","","",NA,"","","N","6/28/2019","7/2/2019",4,"test for UTI on 7/4/19 - negative","PVT","","none","stomach flu (possibly norovirus) one month prior, completely healthy at time of vaccine","none","","",2,"7/7/2019","","Y","Y","none known","MMRV","MERCK & CO.

The patient was a nonconsanguineous boy with normal newborn screening results for severe combined immune deficiency (T-cell receptor excision circles, more than 252 copies/mL), was hospitalized 5 times in the first year of life with dehydration caused by common viral illnesses, including respiratory syncytial virus, norovirus, and coxsackie virus. At 12 months of age, he was hospitalized with fever, cough, and emesis occurring 7 days after vaccination with the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines (manufacturer unknown) (strength, dose, frequency, route, lot# and expiration date were not reported) for prophylaxis (Contraindicated product administered). He rapidly had respiratory insufficiency and abdominopelvic ascites accompanied by diffuse adenopathy. Laboratory evaluation did not suggest a cellular or humoral immunodeficiency. He had pancytopenia, decreased fibrinogen levels, increased ferritin levels, and increased circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor, meeting the clinical criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Meningitis caused by vaccine-strain mumps was confirmed by means of PCR of cerebral spinal fluid. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment (2 g/kg) has been reported to be useful in the management of a STAT2-deficient patient with severe viral infections. Treatment of the patient with high-dose IVIG led to prompt resolution of HLH, with defervescence and normalization of ferritin levels and cell counts. He was subsequently started on IVIG (0.5 g/kg) every 3 weeks and avoids all live viral vaccines. The patient was 2 years old and had not had any further infections, hospitalizations, or episodes of HLH. Targeted next-generation sequencing of the patient's genomic DNA for 207 genes associated with primary immunodeficiency identified a novel homozygous splice donor variant in STAT2. His parents were heterozygous for the variant. No mutations were identified in other genes associated with primary HLH or primary immune deficiency. RT-PCR was performed on mRNA from EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) from control subjects and the patient to determine whether the mutation affected STAT2 splicing. The 533-bp fragment surrounding the mutation site was identified in the control subject. In contrast, a lower molecular weight band of approximately 437 bp was identified in cDNA from the patient's BLCLs. Sanger sequencing demonstrated abnormal splicing in the patient's cDNA amplicon, resulting in deletion of exon 13 and in-frame splicing of exons 12 and 14. Immunoblotting of lysates from BLCLs demonstrated abrogation of STAT2 protein expression in the patient without expression of any truncated protein products. STAT2 deficiency in human subjects and mice is characterized by defective type I interferon signaling. The infection and subsequent transformation of B cells with EBV activates STAT2 and upregulates expression of interferon-stimulated genes, including IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7, which are further increased after exposure to type I interferons. Expression of IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7 was severely decreased in the patient's BLCLs compared with those from control subjects. Furthermore, the patient's BLCLs did not upregulate IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7 after IFN-a stimulation, indicating a lack of STAT2-driven signaling in response to type I interferons.

Meningitis caused by vaccine-strain mumps was confirmed by means of PCR of cerebral spinal fluid. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment (2 g/kg) has been reported to be useful in the management of a STAT2-deficient patient with severe viral infections. Treatment of the patient with high-dose IVIG led to prompt resolution of HLH, with defervescence and normalization of ferritin levels and cell counts. He was subsequently started on IVIG (0.5 g/kg) every 3 weeks and avoids all live viral vaccines. The patient was 2 years old and had not had any further infections, hospitalizations, or episodes of HLH. Targeted next-generation sequencing of the patient's genomic DNA for 207 genes associated with primary immunodeficiency identified a novel homozygous splice donor variant in STAT2. His parents were heterozygous for the variant. No mutations were identified in other genes associated with primary HLH or primary immune deficiency. RT-PCR was performed on mRNA from EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) from control subjects and the patient to determine whether the mutation affected STAT2 splicing. The 533-bp fragment surrounding the mutation site was identified in the control subject. In contrast, a lower molecular weight band of approximately 437 bp was identified in cDNA from the patient's BLCLs. Sanger sequencing demonstrated abnormal splicing in the patient's cDNA amplicon, resulting in deletion of exon 13 and in-frame splicing of exons 12 and 14. Immunoblotting of lysates from BLCLs demonstrated abrogation of STAT2 protein expression in the patient without expression of any truncated protein products. STAT2 deficiency in human subjects and mice is characterized by defective type I interferon signaling. The infection and subsequent transformation of B cells with EBV activates STAT2 and upregulates expression of interferon-stimulated genes, including IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7, which are further increased after exposure to type I interferons. Expression of IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7 was severely decreased in the patient's BLCLs compared with those from control subjects. Furthermore, the patient's BLCLs did not upregulate IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7 after IFN-a stimulation, indicating a lack of STAT2-driven signaling in response to type I interferons.

The patient was a nonconsanguineous boy with normal newborn screening results for severe combined immune deficiency (T-cell receptor excision circles, more than 252 copies/mL), was hospitalized 5 times in the first year of life with dehydration caused by common viral illnesses, including respiratory syncytial virus, norovirus, and coxsackie virus. At 12 months of age, he was hospitalized with fever, cough, and emesis occurring 7 days after vaccination with the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines (manufacturer unknown) (strength, dose, frequency, route, lot# and expiration date were not reported) for prophylaxis (Contraindicated product administered). He rapidly had respiratory insufficiency and abdominopelvic ascites accompanied by diffuse adenopathy. Laboratory evaluation did not suggest a cellular or humoral immunodeficiency. He had pancytopenia, decreased fibrinogen levels, increased ferritin levels, and increased circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor, meeting the clinical criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Meningitis caused by vaccine-strain mumps was confirmed by means of PCR of cerebral spinal fluid. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment (2 g/kg) has been reported to be useful in the management of a STAT2-deficient patient with severe viral infections. Treatment of the patient with high-dose IVIG led to prompt resolution of HLH, with defervescence and normalization of ferritin levels and cell counts. He was subsequently started on IVIG (0.5 g/kg) every 3 weeks and avoids all live viral vaccines. The patient was 2 years old and had not had any further infections, hospitalizations, or episodes of HLH. Targeted next-generation sequencing of the patient's genomic DNA for 207 genes associated with primary immunodeficiency identified a novel homozygous splice donor variant in STAT2. His parents were heterozygous for the variant. No mutations were identified in other genes associated with primary HLH or primary immune deficiency. RT-PCR was performed on mRNA from EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) from control subjects and the patient to determine whether the mutation affected STAT2 splicing. The 533-bp fragment surrounding the mutation site was identified in the control subject. In contrast, a lower molecular weight band of approximately 437 bp was identified in cDNA from the patient's BLCLs. Sanger sequencing demonstrated abnormal splicing in the patient's cDNA amplicon, resulting in deletion of exon 13 and in-frame splicing of exons 12 and 14. Immunoblotting of lysates from BLCLs demonstrated abrogation of STAT2 protein expression in the patient without expression of any truncated protein products. STAT2 deficiency in human subjects and mice is characterized by defective type I interferon signaling. The infection and subsequent transformation of B cells with EBV activates STAT2 and upregulates expression of interferon-stimulated genes, including IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7, which are further increased after exposure to type I interferons. Expression of IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7 was severely decreased in the patient's BLCLs compared with those from control subjects. Furthermore, the patient's BLCLs did not upregulate IFIT1, ISG15, and IRF7 after IFN-a stimulation, indicating a lack of STAT2-driven signaling in response to type I interferons.

"46731",831422,"9/2/2019","LA",4,4,NA,"F","","?Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks.  Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children.  HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications.  The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop.  Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, measles, or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter.  HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine. This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort.  In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure.?  Patient, 4 years old, had to have her vaccines to start Pre-K , so on 8/06/19 she got her vaccinations. Then last Saturday, 8/24/19, she developed a bad cough. She wasn?t better by Monday so we did not send her to school and she went to her doctor that Tuesday, 8/27/19. She was then treated for an upper respiratory infection and had a follow up appointment that Thursday, 8/29/19. We got a call from the school saying she couldn?t bare any weight on her legs and that she had really bad bruising on her legs. She was fine when she got on the bus. Long story short...we get to the ER and after a CT, X-ray, and CBC she was diagnosed with HSP.   From Thursday to Friday her blood pressure was very high and she had blood in her urine. She had bruising from her buttocks to her toes and her palms were bruised. Doctors were in and out like crazy checking blood pressure and examining her joints and the new bruises that were appearing on her legs and feet and even on her hands. She complained that her stomach hurt, her head hurt, her legs hurt, and everyone seemed to be at a loss.  Around 4pm on Friday she still could not walk or move her legs at all and the swelling and bruising had not dissipated. She would scream because the pain in her legs was unbearable. She wanted to take a bath around 4:30 and we thought it would help her joints to sit in a hot bath. She could only bare weight for maybe 5 seconds without crying and saying it hurt. About an hour later she started moving her feet and toes, then bending her knees, and then moving her legs.  Then about 30 minutes later she needed to pee and actually walked back to the bed from the bathroom. Then started bossing people around and wanted to stand and sing us a song. My typical bossy patient! She went to the foot of the bed and started sing. We all started to cry. Prayer works in case you didn?t know.  Saturday morning we thought her IV went bad because her left arm started showing signs of swelling but no bruises. Then we literally sat there and watched her arms start to have bruising appear as she slept. Her swelling was so bad they had to remove her hospital band because it was digging into her skin. Her legs that morning were not as swollen and she seemed to not be in as much pain. The doctors were still worried about her kidney functions and her high blood pressure. We still are not out of the woodwork yet with that.   Thankfully today at 3 yesterday (Sunday) we were able to go home. We still have many months of follow ups to do to check her blood pressure and to do urinalysis to check for protein and blood in her urine and we still have to monitor her input and output. Prayers are still greatly needed and appreciated.  This is a very rare thing that can happen to your little one and I was scared out of my mind with what could be causing this type of reaction. It affected her skin, intestines, kidneys, joints, and now we have at least 4 months of weekly checkups until she is in the clear. Hopefully sooner.   Please SHARE this to let people know that this could happen if your child has had shots (MMR) and then recently received medical attention for an upper respiratory problem. It was the perfect storm for her to get it. There is not much known about the why or how exactly a child contracts this but it can have lifelong affects. Prayers it does not with patient. This was not her first time getting treated for an upper respiratory problem or getting vaccines. But for whatever reason now she has HSP which had this response that is known to be linked to the MMR vaccine.   She had no signs of it when she got on the bus and it didn?t take long to progress and just as quickly it dissipated.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and share. Maybe it will get around to enough people that it will get some awareness and help another child get medical attention sooner.","","","","","Y",4,"","Y","N","8/6/2019","8/29/2019",23,"CT, X-Ray, UA, and CBC","PVT","","None","None","None","","",2,"9/2/2019","","Y","Y","None","MMRV","MERCK & CO.

HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications.  The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop.  Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, measles, or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter.  HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine. This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort.  In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure.?  Patient, 4 years old, had to have her vaccines to start Pre-K , so on 8/06/19 she got her vaccinations. Then last Saturday, 8/24/19, she developed a bad cough. She wasn?t better by Monday so we did not send her to school and she went to her doctor that Tuesday, 8/27/19. She was then treated for an upper respiratory infection and had a follow up appointment that Thursday, 8/29/19. We got a call from the school saying she couldn?t bare any weight on her legs and that she had really bad bruising on her legs. She was fine when she got on the bus. Long story short...we get to the ER and after a CT, X-ray, and CBC she was diagnosed with HSP.   From Thursday to Friday her blood pressure was very high and she had blood in her urine. She had bruising from her buttocks to her toes and her palms were bruised. Doctors were in and out like crazy checking blood pressure and examining her joints and the new bruises that were appearing on her legs and feet and even on her hands. She complained that her stomach hurt, her head hurt, her legs hurt, and everyone seemed to be at a loss.  Around 4pm on Friday she still could not walk or move her legs at all and the swelling and bruising had not dissipated. She would scream because the pain in her legs was unbearable. She wanted to take a bath around 4:30 and we thought it would help her joints to sit in a hot bath. She could only bare weight for maybe 5 seconds without crying and saying it hurt. About an hour later she started moving her feet and toes, then bending her knees, and then moving her legs.  Then about 30 minutes later she needed to pee and actually walked back to the bed from the bathroom. Then started bossing people around and wanted to stand and sing us a song. My typical bossy patient! She went to the foot of the bed and started sing. We all started to cry. Prayer works in case you didn?t know.  Saturday morning we thought her IV went bad because her left arm started showing signs of swelling but no bruises. Then we literally sat there and watched her arms start to have bruising appear as she slept. Her swelling was so bad they had to remove her hospital band because it was digging into her skin. Her legs that morning were not as swollen and she seemed to not be in as much pain. The doctors were still worried about her kidney functions and her high blood pressure. We still are not out of the woodwork yet with that.   Thankfully today at 3 yesterday (Sunday) we were able to go home. We still have many months of follow ups to do to check her blood pressure and to do urinalysis to check for protein and blood in her urine and we still have to monitor her input and output. Prayers are still greatly needed and appreciated.  This is a very rare thing that can happen to your little one and I was scared out of my mind with what could be causing this type of reaction. It affected her skin, intestines, kidneys, joints, and now we have at least 4 months of weekly checkups until she is in the clear. Hopefully sooner.   Please SHARE this to let people know that this could happen if your child has had shots (MMR) and then recently received medical attention for an upper respiratory problem. It was the perfect storm for her to get it. There is not much known about the why or how exactly a child contracts this but it can have lifelong affects. Prayers it does not with patient. This was not her first time getting treated for an upper respiratory problem or getting vaccines. But for whatever reason now she has HSP which had this response that is known to be linked to the MMR vaccine.   She had no signs of it when she got on the bus and it didn?t take long to progress and just as quickly it dissipated.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and share. Maybe it will get around to enough people that it will get some awareness and help another child get medical attention sooner.","","","","","Y",4,"","Y","N","8/6/2019","8/29/2019",23,"CT, X-Ray, UA, and CBC","PVT","","None","None","None","","",2,"9/2/2019","","Y","Y","None","MMRV","MERCK & CO.

"46735",831422,"9/2/2019","LA",4,4,NA,"F","","?Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks.  Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children.
